# Vaccinations in Schools

**Intro** - Currently the anti-vax movement has been growing at a faster rate than in previous years. Using the dataset found at Data.gov (2019), I looked at the schools with kindergarten, schools with 6th grade, and schools with neither kindergarten nor 6th grade to determine if there was any statistical difference when it comes to having all vaccinations, having any exemptions, and the different types of exemptions.

**Tools** - Python, Pandas, Numpy, Thinkstat2, Thinkplot

**Data** - Link to dataset: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/all-students-kindergarten-through-12th-grade-immunization-data-by-school-2016-2017

**Methods/Evaluation/Techniques** - Distributions, Correlation, Covariance

**Conclusion** - Though there were a few mixed results depending on which test was run for what groups, the overall outcome based on most statistical tests was there appeared to be no strong relationship between schools with kindergarten and schools with 6th grade when it comes to having exemptions for vaccinations, although there appears to be a higher chance for a school with kindergarten to have children with all their immunizations.
